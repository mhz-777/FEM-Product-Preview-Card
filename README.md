# Notes

* Frontend mentor hides the FIGMA files behind a paywall which makes me sad. I wish they just included it so I wouldn't have to guess on so many things.
* A month ago this was impossible for me but this time around I finished this in probably an hour-ish give or take.
* This project was a 1 in terms of difficulty and I think that is about right.

All in all fun little project 10/10 would Product Preview again.
